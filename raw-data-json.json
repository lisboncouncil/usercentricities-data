In a session, different users and technicians review the whole path that has been designed to check that the path followed has been the correct one.

The digitalisation of this service aims to speed up, facilitate and automate a process that needs to update the services offered to citizens. The Libraries pilot project was developed in five working sessions of four hours each. Among others, in one session all the prototypes made during the previous sessions were reviewed and validated by citizen users, library service workers and the Director General of Cultural Promotion and Libraries.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n4) Web platform for children, teenagers and young adults: the Directorate General for Child and Adolescent Care (DGAIA) and the Catalan Youth Agency wanted to offer a new digital service aimed at children, adolescents and young people, but also at professionals in the sector. The tool has to consist of a user-friendly web platform and has to facilitate the task of the professional team that will provide the service behind the platform. It also has to have a design, branding, and communication strategy to ensure dissemination among the target audience. The high-level design project has been developed in two context analysis sessions to find out the requirements and expectations of the service, four co-creation sessions with the team and interviews with people from the target groups. User journey experiences were conducted.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n5) Pre-litigation administrative complaint (IT): the Subdirectorate General for Medical Assessments (ICAM) of the Ministry of Health requested the redesign of the service for administrative claims prior to legal proceedings in matters of temporary incapacity. The aim was to bring it closer to the citizen and to facilitate management. The ICAM pilot project was carried out in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Based on a structured script of questions, the meeting is managed to obtain as much information as possible. Interviews are also conducted with citizens, medical professionals from primary care centres and ICAM, and ICAM administrative staff who are familiar with the current system. The user\u0026#039;s travel experience is also realised.

The objective was that the citizen, once informed of the procedure by a doctor, could reflect and sign the consent without having to travel to the medical centre. The ICS pilot project was developed in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Interviews were conducted with patients, medical professionals and researchers with a good knowledge of the current system, its strengths and weaknesses. Validation was also carried out with citizens with different profiles and doctors who need informed consent.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n7) Attendance control occupancy service courses: The SOC (Catalan Employment Service) wants to improve the attendance control system for training courses. The SOC courses used to validate the presence of students by means of a paper signature. This is a problem in terms of the reliability and speed of the process. The pilot project consisted of five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Interviews were conducted with users: students, trainers and administrative staff of the training centres. Also, in a session, different users (students and teachers) and technicians (from the promoter unit and the legal service) have reviewed the solutions provided to verify that the path followed has been the correct one.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nSource: https:\/\/espai.administraciodigital.gencat.cat\/Que-vols-fer\/Dissenyar-servei-digital\/Transformacio-tramits-cap-serveis-digitals\/Pilots-implantacio-Guia-serveis-digitals\/Pagines\/default.aspx \u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n","field_co_userresearch":"No","field_co_userresearch_ev":"","field_co_codesign_dis":"No","field_co_codesign_dis_ev":"","field_co_webanalitycs":"Yes","field_co_webanalitycs_ev":"Analytics services are operating to monitor web navigation and to detect and correct technical errors in the forms, using Google Analytics: https:\/\/ctti.gencat.cat\/ca\/ctti\/solucions-corporatives\/comunicacio-i-relacio\/webs\/analitica-gencat\/, https:\/\/atenciociutadana.gencat.cat\/ca\/serveis\/webs\/analitica\/solucio-tecnologica\/.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThe strategic objectives of analytics are to improve service to citizens, increasing the quality of service, increasing the degree of satisfaction with the service, attracting more users to the website, improving loyalty.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThe operational objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of each action carried out on the website and to balance costs with benefits, to know the demand: identify new services, prioritise those that are most successful, highlight those that are difficult to find..., to know the profile of the audience and to improve positioning.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nFinally, in relation to decision-making, we want to have a methodology that allows us to implement improvements.
