due to national policy (Plasterk 2017) it is mandatory for local authorities to provide public service digitally/online where possible. A ""maturity"" scan on Rotterdam products (406 in total) shows that only 25 of those are physical service only. 75 products are (also) digitally available on level 1, which means ""application by email or PDF form"" and the others (306) are fully digital if desired by the citizen.

Most recent apps are not built as native apps but more modern PWA or webapps. This does not require downloads, but behaves like a native (downloadable) app. PWA or hybrid app have advantages such as more possibilities for swift iteration. The use of these apps vary because current state of affairs is that we have dedicated apps, not 1 fits all app.

There is not one single app used by 20% of the population. The reason for this is in the initial answer: The city of Rotterdam has a different, more agile and contemporary strategy on app-provision. “Native apps” will rarely be added to app stores, because of the benefits of responsive website-apps as explained. Because we have different apps for different targetgroups or goals, they are never used or downloaded by 20%+ of the population. So basically you could say the answer should be changed to “NO” although in our opinion this wouldn’t reflect the service provision through apps by Rotterdam. I can not support this with data before the deadline, but it is likely that 20%+ of the population has ever used ANY app by the municipality, depending on what definition is used for the word “app”.

The Title II, Chapter II is on digital services. In particular, Article 27 (on General principles in the creation of digital services) says ""The subjects (...) of this Decree promote the creation of new digital services in accordance with the principles set out in Article 4 of this Decree and in accordance with the evolution and continuous improvement in the provision of public services, harnessing the full potential of innovation and technology, creating public value and putting users' experience at the heart of service design.""

Finally, some hackathons have been held, such as the following one: https://punttic.gencat.cat/en/esdeveniment/online-technology-hackathon.",Yes,"The Digital Services Guide standardises the principles of design thinking to the development of services, as well as establishes co-design and validation sessions with both users and public employees.

These are some examples of this sessions:

1) Hunting and fishing: the Ministry of Climate Action, Food and Rural Agenda wanted to improve the service offered to citizens and facilitate the digitalisation of the processing of hunting and fishing permits. The pilot project was carried out in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. The prototypes were validated by the fisheries users and the deputy directors of the two directorates-general.

2) Videoconferencing service: the Tax Agency of Catalonia (ATC) wanted to offer to taxpayers the possibility of carrying out some procedures by videoconference, procedures that until now were offered in person or, in some cases, by telephone. The ATC pilot project was developed in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. In a session, different users and technicians review the whole path that has been designed to check that the path followed has been the correct one. More information: https://administraciodigital.blog.gencat.cat/2021/07/26/assistencia-a-la-ciutadania-per-videotrucada-lexperiencia-de-latc-en-el-disseny-de-serveis-digitals/

3) Libraries, Implementation of digital library cards: the Directorate General for Cultural Promotion and Libraries of the Ministry of Culture wants to design the digital processing process to obtain the library card for the whole of Catalonia. The digitalisation of this service aims to speed up, facilitate and automate a process that needs to update the services offered to citizens. The Libraries pilot project was developed in five working sessions of four hours each. Among others, in one session all the prototypes made during the previous sessions were reviewed and validated by citizen users, library service workers and the Director General of Cultural Promotion and Libraries.

4) Web platform for children, teenagers and young adults: the Directorate General for Child and Adolescent Care (DGAIA) and the Catalan Youth Agency wanted to offer a new digital service aimed at children, adolescents and young people, but also at professionals in the sector. The tool has to consist of a user-friendly web platform and has to facilitate the task of the professional team that will provide the service behind the platform. It also has to have a design, branding, and communication strategy to ensure dissemination among the target audience. The high-level design project has been developed in two context analysis sessions to find out the requirements and expectations of the service, four co-creation sessions with the team and interviews with people from the target groups. User journey experiences were conducted.

5) Pre-litigation administrative complaint (IT): the Subdirectorate General for Medical Assessments (ICAM) of the Ministry of Health requested the redesign of the service for administrative claims prior to legal proceedings in matters of temporary incapacity. The aim was to bring it closer to the citizen and to facilitate management. The ICAM pilot project was carried out in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Based on a structured script of questions, the meeting is managed to obtain as much information as possible. Interviews are also conducted with citizens, medical professionals from primary care centres and ICAM, and ICAM administrative staff who are familiar with the current system. The user's travel experience is also realised.

6) Digital informed consent in the field of health care: The pilot project between the Subdirectorate General for Innovation and Digital Administration (SIAD) and the Catalan Health Institute (ICS) focused on the design of the digital Informed Consent. The objective was that the citizen, once informed of the procedure by a doctor, could reflect and sign the consent without having to travel to the medical centre. The ICS pilot project was developed in five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Interviews were conducted with patients, medical professionals and researchers with a good knowledge of the current system, its strengths and weaknesses. Validation was also carried out with citizens with different profiles and doctors who need informed consent.

7) Attendance control occupancy service courses: The SOC (Catalan Employment Service) wants to improve the attendance control system for training courses. The SOC courses used to validate the presence of students by means of a paper signature. This is a problem in terms of the reliability and speed of the process. The pilot project consisted of five working sessions, each lasting four hours. Interviews were conducted with users: students, trainers and administrative staff of the training centres. Also, in a session, different users (students and teachers) and technicians (from the promoter unit and the legal service) have reviewed the solutions provided to verify that the path followed has been the correct one.
